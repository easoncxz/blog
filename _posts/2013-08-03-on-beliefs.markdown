title: Notes on Beliefs
excerpt: Last time I had a conversation with B about beliefs. Afterwards, I scribbled
  on a piece of paper a cloud of scattered thoughts on the topic. This post attempts

<p>Last time I had a conversation with B about beliefs. Afterwards, I scribbled on a piece of paper a cloud of scattered thoughts on the topic. This post attempts to record (and <del>perhaps</del> comment on) these thoughts.<a id="more"></a><a id="more-789"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>Some people "believe in" what could be an <em>explanation</em> to the world. They call this their "religion" or "belief" (or just "how the world is"). What I think is that the act of <em>needing/wanting</em> an explanation, should itself be what "belief" means.</p></blockquote>
<p>(^ I invite you to think of it this way: Some people <em>don't really need</em> an explanation, or say reason (to be fair, perhaps I should say "explanation which is strong to a certain degree") in order to believe something (e.g. "religion"), whereas some people <em>do</em>. I am one of those who "do".)</p>
<blockquote><p>Beliefs are - by my definition/description/understanding - statements that are not inferable through logic. However it is a type of belief to believe this term should be defined this way.</p></blockquote>
<p>(^ I.e., I think of "belief" as being something like some <a title="Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom" target="_blank">axiom</a> of the world. "Beliefs" should be intuitively obvious, rigorously defendable, and somewhat <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_and_sufficient_condition" target="_blank"><em>necessarily</em></a> needed in order for the world(<a href="http://blog.easoncxz.com/?p=794" target="_blank">WTM</a>) to work in the way we observe it to be.)</p>
<blockquote><p>"This provides no evidence against there being a God." - Isn't the <em>act</em> of "needing evidence to believe something is true" - in its own right - a belief?</p></blockquote>
<p>(^ Neither does it provide evidence <em>for</em> there being a God. The "act" is of a point of view somewhat similar to the statistician or perhaps mathematician's one - there could <em>only be</em> evidence <em>against</em>, but never evidence <em>for</em>.)</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This system is consistent.</li>
<li>However this is not evidence for this system being "true".</li>
<li>Stating something doesn't make it "true" (regardless of whether <del>this happened or not</del> it is in fact true).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>(^ The "system" refers to Christianity. This isn't a complex thought.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Ultimately, I might ask questions that (kind of by <del>definition</del> its nature) no one can answer. <del>(I guess this is the case.)</del> But if the person goes "just <em>because</em>!", and I <em>don't</em> accept that as a <em>valid</em> answer (WTM), the reason I don't accept the answer would be an inference（逻辑后承） of what I already believe, hence not allowing anyone or anything to change my <i>belief </i>(WTM).</p></blockquote>

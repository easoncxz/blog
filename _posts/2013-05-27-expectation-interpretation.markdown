title: Expectation -> Interpretation
excerpt: "It branched off a conversation among me, E, and T.\r\n\r\nE first stated
  how he lived on his own tight budget and tried to earn money from work and not financially
  be dependent on his parents. E then stated he wanted to go to McDonald's because
  he was hungry and (more importantly) he craved it. I offered to make him a sandwich,
  but he rejected. I said, \"a more money-saving solution to 'being hungry' compared
  to going to McDonald's is to stock up from CountDown and make your own sandwiches\".
  T disagreed with my point, and he told me how he thought I was \"not getting the
  point\" which is \"E <em>just wanted to</em> have McDonald's\".\r\n\r\nYeah, all

<p>It branched off a conversation among me, E, and T.</p>
<p>E first stated how he lived on his own tight budget and tried to earn money from work and not financially be dependent on his parents. E then stated he wanted to go to McDonald's because he was hungry and (more importantly) he craved it. I offered to make him a sandwich, but he rejected. I said, "a more money-saving solution to 'being hungry' compared to going to McDonald's is to stock up from CountDown and make your own sandwiches". T disagreed with my point, and he told me how he thought I was "not getting the point" which is "E <em>just wanted to</em> have McDonald's".</p>
<p>Yeah, all the discussion between me and T were "hypothetical"; <a id="more"></a><a id="more-614"></a>yet it still tells me something about myself. T made the example of two persons - one is an "A+ average" type of person who spent all his time studying, and the other is a person who got involved in heaps and heaps of "people activities". These two persons were imagined to be attending the interview for a same position at a certain company. T suggests that the "peoples person" in the situation above are more likely to get an offer for the job; and despite T emphasizing how the character in his example are 'hypothetical', I can feel obviously that I am being modeled by the study nerd type. Up to this point, I would presume that T based his statements on other given information, e.g. I am a younger person than him, I take AP, English is my second language.</p>
<p>The problem comes in here. For perhaps any way I express, due to the difference of the way the listener interprets, I could almost always be interpreted in different ways. It's like parsing the same bit sequence using different encoding tables - another encoding table would give you another decoded content. In the actual case, which I think T wouldn't know unless I told him specifically, "telling E not to go to McDonald's" is (or to T, "might be")Â <em>exactly</em> what I had in mind of doing - McDonald's is not essential; as someone who has a bit of difficulty keeping to his budget plan, he should not be eating at McDonald's. In the actual case, even if I understood that E really just wanted to "go to M's" instead of "deal with (?) being hungry", although which I'm not sure whether or not is the case, I would still have said the same thing. If T (confidently) expect me to be able to get E's point, then T would probably interpret my saying as in the "even if - would still" case. For me, experiencing this difference between my expression and how it was interpreted seems to suggest that I'm one more step ahead than before - which is good.</p>

<p>Most people, at most of the time, don't put their point direct, explicit, unambiguous enough. (Myself included, sometimes.) The world and our reading lives would be so much nicer (in my regard) if in stuff we write we all answer questions nice and clear, in about one sentence each:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are you doing?</li>
<li>How do you do that?</li>
<li>Why do you do that?</li>
<li>What are you talking about? / What's the topic?</li>
<li>What do you think about that?</li>
<li>What would you've done about that / What will you do about that?</li>
<li>Why should I care?</li>
</ul>
<p>There aren't many ways (in which I perceive humans) to understand stuff - the ways are just: when, what, who, how, why, where.</p>
<p>Writing/reading or expression/comprehension shouldn't have to be difficult.</p>

<p>i was trying to modify the scrolling speed of my magic mouse, on ubuntu.</p>
<p>actually i think i should've tried the same idea on an ordinary USB mouse beforehand, despite i didn't. here's a useful post:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://blog.matws.net/post/2010/10/16/Correct-magic-mouse-scrolling-on-Linux">Correct magic mouse scrolling on Linux - My not so uninteresting notes</a></p></blockquote>
<p>however, i kind of screwed up my laptop's bluetooth settings, and it didn't recognize my magic mouse anymore. after i tried to fix things up by installing packages named after something like <code>blueman</code> or <code>bluez</code>, my bluetooth did come back on, my magic mouse did connect again, but the method mentioned in that post didn't work any longer but instead screwed up the bluetooth settings every time i tried it, each causing me to reinstall the two blue-ish packages again.</p>
<p>not very nice ending.</p>

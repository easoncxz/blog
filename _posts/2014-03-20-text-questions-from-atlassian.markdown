<p>I briefly filed an application at Atlassian; I then got an email with a link to a seemingly personalised online test. Their questions match the info I gave them in my application <em>so accordingly</em> that I'm imagining they either had a fancy application-auto-processing keyword-extracting machine learning algorithm and system, or some humans to read the applications.</p>
<p>I am sharing the questions that I faced in the test. What I said I was able to do included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python, Java</li>
<li>OOP, design patterns, Java generics, essential functional programming</li>
</ul>
<p>And the test pretty much hit me spot-on on those topics.</p>
<h2>Test questions</h2>
<p>Suggested time: 1.5h; actual used: ~3h.</p>
<p>5 multi-choice; 3 coding; 2 short-answer.</p>
<p>1.1 Singleton pattern: An implementation was given, and it asks to identify what's wrong.</p>
<p>1.2 JVM method invocation mechanism: Don't know what this was, but "&lt;init&gt;", "&lt;clinit&gt;" was mentioned.</p>
<p>1.3 try-finally block: What happens if in "try" I return true, but in "finally" I return false?</p>
<p>1.4 "char" in Java: How many bits is used under the hood? Is it a signed or unsigned number?</p>
<p>1.5 Run-time typechecking against generic type: What's wrong with doing "if (myObject instanceof List<Thingy>)"?</p>
<p>2.1 Write a method that takes two arrays and returns the index on the first array, from which point on the subarray of it is the same as the second array.</p>
<p>2.2 A recursive implementation of a fold was given (taking an initial value, a list, and a function). Change it to iterative.</p>
<p>2.3 An interface of a ternary tree is given. (With heaps of generics used, e.g. "Either&lt;Type, Triple&lt;Tree&lt;Type&gt;>>") Write a method that returns a list of leafs in order of in-order traversal.</p>
<p>3.1 Name a product you use, and a way to improve it.</p>
<p>3.2 Market yourself within 140 chars.</p>

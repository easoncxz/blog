<p>With the tools from <a href="http://blog.easoncxz.com/?p=1078">grammar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a> etc., learning a language shouldn't require the old-school learn-by-example or learn-by-immersion approach. Instead, learning it "the hard way" - diving straight into theory - should be more efficient for people like me.</p>
<p>I need to point out early in this post, that <strong>surely pratical language usage exercise is necessary</strong> - just that the theory behind "why the sentences are the way they are" deserves explanation <strong>before</strong> rather than after they have been learnt.</p>
<p>What I mean by "analytic":</p>
<p>Go straight to questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does sentence structure change? How do I ask a WH-question sentence? How about a yes-no question? Rhetorical question?</li>
<li>How do verbs change? How many tenses are there? What do each of them mean?</li>
<li>How do nouns change? Is there a distinction between singular and plural? What signifies it?</li>
<li>How do pronouns change? How many different <em>persons</em> are distinguished? What does each of them mean? </li>
<li>How do adjectives change?</li>
</ul>
<p>It even works for pronunciation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a sound in a language that I already know that sounds exactly the same as the sound you want?</li>
<li>What is a word that has only the first vowel different from the word we were talking about?</li>
<li>How can I slightly modify one of my already-learnt sounds to get that sound? (e.g. round a /i/ into a /y/)</li>
</ul>
<p>And when given a currently-intuitively-weird sentence, e.g. "Il n'y en a pas", "J'en ai marre", "Qu'est-ce que c'est", "Comment s'appelle-t-il", to care more about asking questions like "Why is this sentence structured this way? What does each part mean? <a href="http://blog.easoncxz.com/?p=1085">Are there other sentences that are structured similarly (or demonstrate the same weird adjective behaviour)?</a>" instead of caring to "simply learn that one sentence".</p>
<p>In short, this is about adopting a mathematician-like mindset of how to learn: find a general solution, not a specific one. Deal with the issue once and for all.</p>

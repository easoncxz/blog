<p>Today I <em>randomly</em> attended a small talk about Christianity vs. evolution. This post is not about that talk itself.</p>
<p>I didn't know that it was one session of a regular meeting plan of a Christian student group until I got there. This post is about some questions I discussed with a few Christian fellas, after the talk.</p>
<p>It was in general fun, because I actually questions like "so what does Jesus say about the heat death of the universe?" be raised.</p>
<p>Here are some questions which I think can get you thinking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some questions raised at the venue:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Christianity? What makes a Christian
<p>"The belief that God (and the Trinity stuff) exists."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does "God" mean? (i.e. the definition)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does "exist" mean? (again, definition)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does God <em>need</em> to exist (in order for things to be the way we observe to be)?</p>
<p>"Yes." Because: 1, "there seems to be things here (in our universe)"; and 2, "every thing needs a "cause", which is also a thing". Hence if there isn't a God, there'll be a infinite recursion of finding "causes", which I guess sucks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Where</em> does God exist?</p>
<p>IMHO, not in our universe; most intuitively before the Big Bang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What <em>is</em> a "universe"? (more of a physics question)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can</em> God do anything to our universe? (I mean, it's a universe afterall.)</p>
<p>"Yes." Even if/though the Big Bang <em>is a Big Bang</em>, God "still has the chance to interact with our universe after the Big Bang" - e.g. when someone next prays.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does God <em>do</em> to us or the universe we're in?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the consequences (esp. to the consistency, logical or physics-wise, of our universe) of God's actions on our universe? Wouldn't the interaction of God and our universe affect the consistency of our universe, or make God observable/study-able?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Other questions I had later:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does God say about those who "aren't Christian"? Is not being Christian <em>wrong</em> by the Christian standard?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the God that "caused" the universe to happen the same one as what the Christians are talking about? How can I tell whether those two concepts <em>are</em> the same thing (or not)? Couldn't the people who wrote the Bible meant a different meaning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to now, it's just been about God's effect on the physical world. What about the mathematical world? Could God have created a world in which there are no such thing as or similar to logic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does God even have to <em>obey</em> logic, i.e. be logically consistent?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When did the stuff in the Old Testament (e.g. Eden Garden &amp; stories) happen? (I.e. where within the history of {human / Earth / the universe} are the stories?)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Take an example. Suppose American manufacturers sell dig-<br />

<p>If that were the end of the story, the gains and losses from<br />
foreign trade would wash out. But the story goes on. I'm not so<br />
happy selling cameras at $75, so I'll start considering alterna-<br />
tives. Maybe I'll switch to making cell phones. Maybe I'll retire<br />
early and devote the rest of my life to playing World ofWarcraft.<br />
Whatever I decide, <em>my decision cannot make me additionally worse</em><br />
<em>off, because it's voluntary.</em> If getting out of the camera business<br />
made me worse off, I'd stay in the camera business.</p></blockquote>
<p>这里显然假设了「退出」的商家对于自己的「退出」行为（所损失）的价值的估计是准确的。这个假设从何满足？仅从（或许）「取许多商家的平均」是不够充分的。说不定我退出导致了我更大的<em>实际</em>亏损呢？</p>
<h4>2</h4>
<blockquote><p>To a true believer, what purpose could such dialogues pos-<br />
sibly serve? At the end of the evening, does anyone ever switch<br />
religions? Or do they simply present opposing viewpoints ("Jesus<br />
died on the cross for our sins," "Jesus ascended bodily into<br />
heaven," "Jesus was an ordinary mortal"), after which everyone<br />
nods sagely and then goes home? That's not how people act when<br />
they actually believe they're right. In my experience, if you fill a<br />
room with people who have conflicting beliefs about important<br />
matters of fact, they don't leave until they've either figured out<br />
who's right or collapsed from exhaustion.</p></blockquote>
<p>这个又提到了<em>Truthseekers</em>的话题了。</p>
<blockquote><p>But if they disagree about the capital of South Dakota,<br />
neither etiquette nor common practice requires them to hold<br />
their tongues. They offer evidence; they try to figure out who's<br />
mistaken, and if anything important hangs in the balance, they<br />
keep at it till they've resolved the matter. If they disagreed about<br />
the divinity of Jesus, I'd expect them to do the same-unless,<br />
of course, the disagreement is all for show in the first place, in<br />
which case they might as well move on to some equally unim-<br />
portant topic.</p></blockquote>
<p>这是我在现实生活中总是担心会出现的问题。</p>
<p>在我看来，我和某人的关系不值得因所谓「信仰」的争论而变得不好。在此书作者看来，我（i.e. 本人） 不去真的投入去争论「信仰」问题是因为我自己事实到底<em>是</em>怎样子的。</p>
<p>可是从另一角度看，别人 不/不感兴趣 跟我进行 争论/真正的讨论 的原因虽然可能是跟我（对称地）相同，但是也可能是因为其人对于这个事情根本就「不看重」或者「不虔诚」。</p>
<h4>3</h4>
<p>这个是和我所持的观点完全一致的论述。这是我不觉得又多少人真正「信教」的原因（不管是什么教；但基督教很明显，因为身边不少自称为之者）。</p>
<blockquote><p>There you see the paradox: People who are deeply curi-<br />
ous about the origins of species, the nature of consciousness,<br />
the nature of mental illness, and so on will tend to be aware of<br />
those errors and hence tend to reject religion. People who are<br />
not deeply curious about those things might embrace religion,<br />
but they cannot embrace it deeply, because they're not really<br />
interested in the things that religion is about. Who's left to be<br />
religious?</p></blockquote>
<h4>4</h4>
<blockquote><p>Unless you are an expert in mathematical logic, you probably<br />
have no idea how to prove the consistency of arithmetic, and<br />
if you are an expert in mathematical logic, then you are well<br />
aware that any such proof relies on principles that are no easier<br />
to accept than the conclusion itself--so that if you're willing to<br />
buy the proof, you might as well just skip ahead and buy the<br />
conclusion. 2 In other words, your perception of consistency does<br />
not rely on proof. If it does not rely on proof, it surely cannot<br />
rely on having seen or heard a proof. In other words, it is purely<br />
extrasensory.</p></blockquote>
<p>要是我没有学习过数学，某人怎么能 推断/证明 我能够「感知」到 "2+2=4" 呢？我想，我不通过任何「感知」是能够「学会」「数学」的。而且，即便我还真就「悟出」了 "2+2=4"，此人又是怎么 得知/证明 的呢？</p>
<h4>后</h4>
<p>我打算将这本书的评论就此打住。这是因为我（准备考试的时候）心急地速速看完了整本书，而一路上没有作记录；现在懒得回过头去重新找出亮点来了。</p>
<p>又或者，这本书无非也就这样了。讨论大问题的貌似基本只有第一个部分——当然这也有可能是因我没有努力读后面三个部分所造成的错觉——而后面的部分讲的其实多少应该算是更为 面向生活/务实 的内容。换句话说，此书的抽象层次在递减。</p>
<p>书中其实是提到了不少有趣的概念的。例如，哥德尔不完备定律就被讨论到了。（随之我倒也了解了皮亚诺公理这个东西。）宗教、Truthseeker、量子论，也略有涉猎。</p>
<p>不过，我感觉作者的主观性是十分强的。有的地方强得有理据；有的地方我就未免感到其有点牵强。总的来说，此书的好处是在于<em>故事讲得够好听</em>，能够让我这种没什么 动力/心思/耐心 看书的人也算是津津有味地看完了，而且也有（虽少量的）收获。</p>

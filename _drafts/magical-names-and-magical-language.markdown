<li>Shakespear: "giving a value a name"(John DeNero) vs. "rose any other name as sweet" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet</a></li>
<li>LostAbaddon: 文写则死；文读则生。 <a href="http://www.jianshu.com/p/ddc6a8716f9f">http://www.jianshu.com/p/ddc6a8716f9f</a></li>
<li>thought uses languages; but language can in turn shape, lead, or mis-lead thought.</li>
<li>observed electrons change their velocity/location; uttered words lose their magic; spoken emotions become insincere. Reinterpreting the text written gives a mental inertia; like water flowing on a sandy surface for the first time -- the first time it flows through, the path is random, but as it flows a track/trench is formed; the next time some water wants to flow, it would, naturally, first "want" to flow along the previously-created trenches.</p></li>

  <p>If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all... this includes the things you say to yourself. Words have power. Make sure you choose the right ones that will help you, rather than the wrong ones that will stop you from achieving.
  Love you nerds. Good night. wink emoticon

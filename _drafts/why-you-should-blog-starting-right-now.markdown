# 1) Why you should start blogging (starting right now)

Put in a nutshell, **keeping a blog has many benefits, while no obvious 
downsides**. [TODO][TODO] 

Let me put this down in more detail: **Recording your valueable thoughts in the 
form of a blog can bring many benefits, but doesn't have any obvious 
disadvantages**. Note: things like mumbling about trivialities, miscellaneous 
emotional dumps, or writing for the sake of it etc. -- they don't count as 
valueable thoughts.

Here's in my opinion a few of the greatest benefits of keeping a long-term blog:

**1) You can encounter friends of similar ambitions.**[TODO][TODO] While I write 
my own blog, I also read others' blogs too. In this Information Era, perhaps 
most people's only channel of getting to know more friends is through the 
internet. But through the wire, how would we be able to tell whether the other 
person has common interests with ourselves? Trying to do such distinguishment by 
reading through assorted SNS posts seems far too difficult. [TODO][TODO] Those 
friends of mine whom I admire almost all use blogs as a long-term effort for 
recording thoughts; **hence even if we haven't met in a long time, we'd still 
know each others' thoughts very well.** Even friends whom you haven't met in 
person before might inspire enjoyable conversations when you meet.

Why does blogging far outrun primitive conversational methods when it comes to 
getting to know people with whom you share ambitions? It's quite simple: 
**Firstly, blogs are free of geographical limitations. On the internet, from 
anywhere to anywhere else is always just one click away,** while the usual ways 
of making friends are limited to where you happen to be. Secondly, and more 
importantly, if we make friends the conventional way, we'll need to have 
conversations with each other, share thoughts, gradually get familiar with each 
other -- which could very well be a long process. What's worse, is when you meet 
*another* stranger, you'll have to repeat the whole process again, just to 
reiterate whatever it is that you've talked about with your old friends years 
back. Blogging achieves **"write once, read everywhere"**. Whenever I've read a 
blog which someone has been keeping for many years, I always feel as if I've 
talked much with that person and that I known him/her very well already. **In 
the words of programmers, "blogging greatly increases the reusability of 
language".** 

[I've kept a blog on CSDN for nearly six years][TODO], and created a Google 
Groups group ([TopLanguage][TODO]). Due to the fact that my long-time blog 
reader (and I) already share quite a lot in common, that group has seen 
enthusiastic conversations right from its beginning. And because some quality 
technical discussions have been happening there, even more people [TODO][TODO] 
joined in; and so the snowball rolled. In about a year and a half, I've learnt 
many things from discussions in this group [^1][]. For those who aren't 
programmers, SongShuHui [TODO][TODO] is a good example too.

**2) Writing is better thinking.** I summarized the good things about writing in 
[*Write for a clearer mind*][TODO], so I won't copy and paste it here. The thing 
about our thinking process is, that if we don't make a note of thoughts, they'll 
just slip away. In [*Anecdotes of maths 
geniuses*](http://blog.csdn.net/fgs2008/article/details/570561) (honour belongs 
to ukim), there's this story about Hilbert: Once in a seminar of Hilbert's, a 
young man used an elegant theorem in his talk. Hilbert said, "This is a really 
beautiful (wunderbaschon) theorem. Who discovered it?" The young man was 
confused: "It's you, sir..."

**3) Teaching is the best learning.** [If you're not able to explain something 
clearly, there's a fair chance you haven't actually mastered it.][TODO] You'll 
likely have heard that in the software industry's interviews, the interviewer 
often asks you to explain something to him, while saying that he/she "doesn't 
know about it beforehand", and your job is to explain until he/she gets it.  
(The effect is stronger when he/she *really* didn't know about the topic 
beforehad.)

In order to turn someone who "doesn't get it" into someone who "does", you must 
know exactly which concepts are the ones that needs to be mastered to get one 
from "not getting it" to "getting it". This forces you to turn your tree of 
knowledge upside-down, look at your knowledge "under the hood", and **dig out 
all those knowledge you took for granted and those assumptions you made without 
realising**, and move them from [Implicit Memory][TODO] to [Explicit 
Memory][TODO]. Only a person who knows, **and knows that he knows**, all the 
frames down the stack of abstraction, would be able to give [an explanation 
that's crystal 
clear](http://mindhacks.cn/2008/07/07/the-importance-of-knowing-why/).

But then you might wonder: apart from being able to explain things clearly, 
what's so good about knowing which things you know? After all, I might not 
bother making the effort unless I want to be a teacher.

[sagasw](http://sunxiunan.com/) on TopLanguage once told us this little story: 
**in a famous software company, you'll find a teddy bear on the each developer's 
desk. Before asking each other questions, everyone first iterates the question 
to the teddy bear to start with, to see whether he's able to clearly state the 
question. It endded up oftening being the case that once the question is clearly 
iterated, the answer just comes naturally.** Of course, you don't *have to* talk 
to the *teddy bear* -- you can simply imagine a person who knows little about 
your topic, and try explaining stuff to him. This is practicable; I often do so 
when I'm on the road. But if you're sitting down, I suggest that you give your 
words to an actual audience -- namely, write down your thinking, because 
[writing is better 
thinking](http://mindhacks.cn/2009/02/09/writing-is-better-thinking/).

Most of our knowledge is hidden in our subconsciousness most of the time, 
because our window of consciousness is very small, and our working memory can 
only fit few entries. (Remember that Flash minigame where you try to memorize as 
many as possible simultaneously flashing numbers on the screen?) [Most of the 
time our reasoning process is done 
automatically](http://www.douban.com/subject/1005576/), taking place in our 
subconsciousness -- and we can only sense the existance of few intermidiate 
corollaries. Try it our yourself: count the number of times you had a discussion 
with someone where you were thinking **"Well quite intuitive to me, that's 
obviously true. However if you ask me why, I wouldn't actually know what's going 
on in there."** **Doesn't it bother you? If not even yourself can support your 
own propositions using logic, how could you be so sure that it's indeed true?  
Simply because your hunch tells you so? Well then what happens if a person 
standing right next to you hold an opposite view on the matter, and *he* has a 
strong hunch that *he's* right? "His hunch is wrong, while my hunch is 
correct."? So you're really that confident of your intuition?**

I don't know about you, but I for one **cherish moments like these** -- namely 
moments when "I strongly feel that it's true, but I can't explain why". It's 
moments like these that your brain is **running around places, looking 
everywhere putting together all the pieces of the puzzle, questioning the 
obvious, correcting false assumptions, and working it all out.** On the other 
hand, moments when you think **"I really think there's something wrong about 
this statement, but I don't know *what*."** are also extremely meaningful 
moments, because they almost always mean that you're holding a certain bias, 
having certain misunderstandings of the matter, unknowingly introduced an 
underlying assumption, or swapped out an important concept etc. It's exactly 
during moments like these that you're deep in reflection. When you've dug to the 
roots, and seen the whole iceberg beneath the surface, you will have this grand 
sense of achievement and satisfaction for finally knowing how you knew what you 
know.

Why did I mention the above? I've been saying that we should make good use of 
such chances of reflection. But **if you regularly summarize your system of 
knowledge, and iterate it for your readers, you'll have found that you've 
created those chances by yourself, for yourself**. If you don't reflect enough 
in our day-to-day life, you'll think that many things are "obvious"; but as soon 
as you need to explain it to someone, you'll immediately realise that the whole 
thing ain't so "obvious" afterall. As you try to explain, you'll find yourself 
using the word "anyway" before you notice.

And so the chance of reflection arose.

**As soon as you dig stuff out from the back of your mind, you have the chance 
of direcly facing them and hence reflecting upon them, instead of letting them 
steer your thoughts subconsciously.** Oftentimes when there's a problem in our 
reasoning, it's not because we can't reflect, but because we don't know of our 
hidden assumptions. **How would you know what has gone wrong, if you didn't know 
the reasoning your brain did before arriving at the conclusion?** On the other 
hand, once we figure out the process of reasoning we've gone through to get to 
the conclusion, we won't be too far away from finding the error in our thought 
process -- if a person who's debating with you only ever states his position, 
you'll find it hard to debat with him, whereas if he exposes to you the process 
of his reasoning, it'll be a much easier job to criticise. (And for the same 
reason, some people like to hide their reasoning behind their backs, rather than 
yanking them out.)

Most of the time [we reach conclusions without much thinking, like a wound-up 
clockwork](http://book.douban.com/subject/1005576/), while we don't really know 
how these conclusions are reached, or what was going on behind the scenes of our 
thoughts. Hence when we discover that our conclusion is wrong, we're lost, not 
able to find the bug that caused it. If you pay close attention to peoples' 
sayings (blogs, forums etc.), and split their prose into "pre-condition", 
"assumption", "proof", "conclusion", you'll soon realise that most of what most 
people do is stating conclusions, declaring positions, with little trace of 
pre-conditions, assumptions, and logic deduction. It's usually not that they 
really aren't willing to write down their logic; it's just that reflecting on 
one's own thought process is a really difficult thing to do. Too much of our 
reasoning happen under the water -- only the bubbles of noteworthy conclusions
float to the surface, which we'll then be able to grasp. And this hasn't even 
mentioned that we actually usually end up using a [thinking 
shortcut](http://www.douban.com/subject/1005576/) instead of a proper, complete 
chain of logic.

**To teach an oblivious is the strongest way to reflect** -- because he doesn't 
have any preparative knowledge. In order to let him understand what you know, 
you must completely decompose your tree of knowledge, figure out the foundation 
on which this whole monument is build, where its load-bearing structures are, 
and how it's laid out brick by brick. You can't just stand on floor 11, and 
assume that your reader is standing on floor 10, hoping that just by telling him 
what's there on floor 11 you'd be able to let him "get it". Your reader is 
always standing on the ground floor. You have to know how all those 11 floors 
beneath you are built. **It's this that requires you to perform a complete, 
thorough re-examination of all that you've mastered, or all that you *thought* 
was correct. The more innocent and oblivious your audience is, the deeper your 
reflection would need to be.**

**4) Discussion is excellent reflection.** Sometimes we don't *actually* want to 
explain stuff to someone who has *no idea at all* about your topic -- instead, 
we often end up explaining things to our peers in the same field. It's not true 
that in this case there's no more "reflection" -- you'll in fact realise that if 
you publicly discuss your ideas, you'll **most likely run into people who hold 
different or opposite opinions**, and **by comparing your view with his**, 
you'll realise that there are divergences right at the beginning of the streams 
of thoughts of the two of you. Now the natural question is: "where did this 
divergence come from?" **As the discussion between you two progesses deeper, 
you're each forced by each other to show deeper reasoning**. As opposed to 
"explaining to an outsider", this is also an effective way of encouraging 
yourself to reflect. The deeper the discussion and questioning goes, the closer 
you'll be from the essence of the issue, the more likely it'll be that you 
discover hidden differences in thinking that you'll likely overlook otherwise. 
**And so you'll have had another valueable chance to inspect your own knowledge 
in seek of false information.**

**5) It encourages you to continue learning and thinking.** If you didn't have a 
habit of persistently learning and thinking, your blog will soon run out of 
things to write about, or just end up being a record of daily trivialities or 
reposts of blog posts of others. Your readers would leave, and you'll end up 
closing your blog, and then you'd also give up blogging altogether, then you'd 
discover that there's now one less way of encouraging yourself to reflect and 
learn, and then you'd be even less keen on reflecting and summarizing, and 
then...

Don't get caught in this sort of vicious circle. Don't permanently stop 
blogging. Even if you don't publish any posts for two or three months, as long 
as every post in your blog is the outcome of your own meaningful thinking, your 
blog will be discovered by others on the internet -- because lots of information 
aggregation platforms [TODO][TODO] are begging for valueable content like that. 
There are search engines to provide a vast possible audience to your content; 
there are people who are looking for and forwarding these meaningful content. 
**The worst decision we can make is to stop doing something that doesn't cause 
any harms, but does many goods.**

In order to make your blog valueable, you must continuously summarise what 
you've learnt; you must think continuously, reveal deeper truths, and pose 
independent opinions. This might seem like some upside-down logic, but it'll 
make sense very soon. [TODO][TODO] 

**6) You can learn to do something persistently.** Lots of people feel lost in 
life, not knowing what to do. This is because they didn't find a thing they can 
keep on doing. In the words of Positive Psychology[TODO][TODO], these people 
don't have things in which they can experience 
[Flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)). Writing down one's own 
thoughts seems to be something that often creates a "flow" experience. This is 
especially true when it comes to writing rationally: the brain enters a "logical 
deduction" mode, and all unhappy emotions and frustration silently fades away.  
But then again, the pre-condition of the whole thing is that you *start* 
writing. After you've made it through [TODO][TODO] the most difficult initial 
period, it will all just come naturally to you.

**7) A long-term blog is the best CV.** Here, "CV" isn't just specifically the 
piece of document you use when seeking a job. After all, it's currently not yet 
the **era of valueable blogs** -- most people are just re-blogging articles from 
around the internet, or just posting smalltalk; hence the interviewer wouldn't 
really take personal blogs as a serious, reliable means of knowing about the 
applicant. Here, "CV" is a window through which others can get to know you.  
Although one might not be able to make one's blog a pillar of one's career, like 
Yonghao Luo [TODO][TODO] or Keso (who made 5gme) has done, at least **you can 
get to know more people because of blogging. The more valueable your blog is, 
the more _capable_ [TODO][TODO] the people you get to know in this way would be, 
and the more your knowledge horizon would extend, and then you'll be able to 
grasp opportunities and jump to touch your goals, and then you'll gradually 
become more _capable_ [TODO][TODO] yourself as well... This is a virtuous 
cycle.**

# 2) How to keep a long-term valueable blog

It's worth noting that I didn't mean anything about "perseverance" -- when 
thinking, summarising and externalising has become a habit, putting thoughts 
down into words and in return using words to assist thinking would have already 
become a habit too. Thoughts will be begging to be written down -- the blog 
itself will have become merely a by-product.

At first you think long and hard about things, trying to summarise thoughts into 
words so that you have a blog post, hoping to let people feel a bit of novelty. 
Later down the path, because you're accustomed to thinking and reflecting, and 
because you realise that writing is better thinking, you just _have to_ turn 
your thought process into words. Up to this point, the purposes will finally 
start to seem the right way around -- we're not trying to assist blogging by 
thinking, but rather assist thinking by blogging.

Well then how do we pull off this long term effort? I can imagine people giving 
various little techniques as advice to bring more motivation and inspiration, 
e.g. how to do better SEO, how to encourage readers' interaction etc.. I need 
not mention all of those; I will only mention what's in my opinion the most 
important thing:

> Become a person who persistently learns and contemplates. Write only the 
> outcomes of true thought. All the rest will fit themselves in place.

This is in the same spirit as the rather well-known saying that "Do what you 
love; the money will follow".[^2]

There are lots of examples around this topic; I'll save the effort of listing 
them. What I need to re-emphasise is that: whatever you do, do _not_ post 
trivial chat and small talk. I can appreciate the urge to sometimes rant about 
stuff, but now there is a perfect medium for that -- Twitter. Stop posting 
things on your blog that did _not_ come from sufficient thought on your side. 
Think "think long and hard". Readers who subscribe to your blog wish to receive 
_signal_, not _noise_.  **If you really can't help but want to talk about those 
trivialities, step into others' shoes and think to yourself: if they wrote such 
a piece on _their_ blog, would _you_ want to spent your time reading and 
filtering through it?**

# 3) Possible problems, and some strategies for coping with them

Even though the prose above gave lots of reasons why _to_ write a blog, 
sometimes all it needs to take to hold a potential blogger back is just one 
reason to _not blog_. As mentioned in the fifth chapter of _Influencer: The 
Power to Change Anything_ [^3][]
[amazon](http://www.amazon.cn/Influencer-The-Power-to-Change-Anything-Kerry-Patterson/dp/007148499X/) 
[douban](http://book.douban.com/subject/3130904/)
[one-amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Revised-Edition/dp/006124189X/)
[one-douban](http://book.douban.com/subject/1005576/)
-- "Much of will is skill". **Whether or not you're can be determined enough 
largely depends on your methodology.**

**1) Worrying that people consider your blog is not valueable.** The problems 
that you face would more likely than not to have been faced by others before 
too. If you put your independent thinking into the issue, the outcome is pretty 
much valueable by definition. Of course, it wouldn't be a surprise that there 
may be people who really _does just already know_ what you're talking about in 
your blog post; but then however "smart" you are, there's always going to be 
people who're "smarter". We shouldn't reject recording our thoughts just because 
there are "smarter" people out there; good understanding of a topic always only 
comes after one's own thought. Besides, even if other people has thought about 
a certain topic, there's always aspects of the topic that aren't yet covered, 
thoughts people haven't thought. When putting thought into things has become a 
habit, your ability to think and analyse things will steadily grow, and your 
blog posts will become steadily more valueable. Let me repeat this: **Whatever 
problem you're facing, must have been faced by others already. Whatever comes 
out of your long and hard thinking will always be valueable to many.**

It is also possible that **after you've "figured it out", you consider that 
"this topic is actually really simple", and "not worthy of a blog post"**. Be 
aware, that problems always seem "simple" when you've already "got it". It's not 
how difficult the problem seems in hindsight that matters -- it's **how much 
process it requires you to go through before you can get from confused to 
clear** that counts. The more time and effort it took you to make that 
transition, the more people out there would we expect to not have done the same.  
The harder the task, the fewer the conquerors.

Although if I now look back at articles I wrote a year ago, I might think 
they're immature or incomplete in their thinking, if it weren't through such a 
process of writing, thinking and repeating that I've gone through, I wouldn't 
have arrived at the position today at which I can make such comments in 
hindsight. In the same way, it's quite likely that when in a few years' time I 
look back at my writings today, they will seem similarly "immature" and 
"incomplete".

**2) Worrying that your thoughts are too naîve or flawed and that others will 
laugh at it.** We're all human; we make mistakes. It's exactly because an 
individual's thought is almost always incomplete, that we should share our 
thinking and fill in each other's cracks. The possibility of your mistakes being 
pointed out is exactly what's required to reduce them and improve. Thoughts that 
are always hidden behind your back and never spoken of will never become mature.

"Much of intelligence is knowledge." There is a thought-provoking [TODO][TODO] 
pyschology experiment [^4][]:

> Split some children into two groups, and give them different reading material. 
> For one group, give material that claims intelligence is innate, and 
> un-change-able via effort. For the other group, give material that claims 
> "intelligence" is just another word to mean knowledge and skill, and is 
> entirely dependent on one's effort. Subsequently, the children are asked to 
> perform a set of tasks. Those in the innate-intelligence group tend to avoid 
> difficult tasks and pick the easy ones. We can imagine the logic going on: "If 
> I pick the difficult tasks, the probablity of failure will be larger, and I 
> will give others the impression that I am of less intelligence. In order to 
> avoid my apparent intelligence level from decreasing, I should avoid those 
> tasks that I'm more likely to fail at." Children from the other group tend to 
> be more willing at attempting the more challenging tasks, and is noticeably 
> less disheartened than those from the first group when faced with failure -- 
> because even if the task resulted in a failure, more knowledge, skill and 
> experience is gained in the process, and the level of intelligence must have 
> increased either way.

Besides, those who only know to criticise or even ridicule others are the least 
helpful people. Just ignore them.

**3) Worrying that you aren't getting reward.** This is actually a rather 
irrelevant question. Only blogs that talk about nothing but trivialities would 
face such a concern. If what you write down is your own thinking, then just the 
fact that you've thought about it carefully enough such that you're able to 
write it down is itself already supposed to be a rewarding thing, even if you 
were to write it in your private little notebook. Besides, if you are authoring 
a valueable blog, you shouldn't worry at all about its popularity. Maybe in the 
beginning it would start out small, but that's a necessary step of the process.  
Both [Paul Buchheit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buchheit), a core member 
of the Gmail team and the founder of FriendFeed, and Jeff Atwood have exclaimed: 
"Overnight success takes a long time." 
([(1)](http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2009/01/overnight-success-takes-long-time.html), 
[(2)](http://blog.codinghorror.com/overnight-success-it-takes-years/)). However 
nowadays, there are more and more information aggregation services on the 
internet, some where humans do the work, some where bots do; from the viewpoint 
of idendipendent bloggers, the situation is favourable and encouraging, and it's 
even still getting better.

**4) Worrying that you've got nothing to write about.** This is also quite an 
irrelevant concern. The process of thinking is not one you can rush on. Those 
who subscribe to my blog long-term will know that my publishing frequency is 
about 3 to 5 posts per month. In fact sometimes I don't have anything published 
for months. The reason behind such delays is simple: either I've got urgent work 
at hand that I need to deal with before some deadline, or that the problems I 
was facing were big ones, which would require more time and more thought into 
them. It doesn't really matter that you keep your blog quiet while you think 
carefully -- if you don't feel like you've thought enough for a blog post, just 
keep working at it until you're ready. There's a difference between those who 
are keen on thinking and those who aren't: the former always has a few topics 
floating at the back of their mind, which comes out to centre stage and demands 
thought whenever the mind has its moments of pause; the latter doesn't have such 
floating topics -- they don't even pro-actively think about anything, and even 
always tries to let others "help" them do the thinking for them when they're 
faced with a difficulty.

It's ok to spend some more time and learn to think slowly. Dig deep on a topic, 
and you'll always find edges and corners overlooked by others. The longer you 
can leave a question floating in your mind, the more likely it is that you 
discover new things about the topic. Usually, for questions which I consider 
valueable, I would keep thinking about it intermittently, consciously or 
subconsciouslyl, for some period of time, ranging from a week to a month, 
depending on the difficulty/complexity of the issue, and use the free time when 
I walk, eat to think about the issue. (I've discovered that many people who I 
admire have similar thinking habits.) **Sometimes even when I thought I've 
thought enough about it and wrote and published an article on an issue, my mind 
still has the inertia of thinking about it subconsciously; and hence when I then 
come across a certain article or book I would again be struck with new ideas and 
sentiments.**

**The ability of letting questions linger in one's subconsciousness is a 
capability that can bring great benefits. The longer the thinking has happened 
in your head, the more you'd be able to see compared to others.** Only by 
observing the world around us _while we are holding thoughts_ would we be able 
to make new discoveries. The typical example is Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment -- 
if he hadn't keep thinking about the same question during his "down time" for a 
long period, how would he have been able to come to the realisation of "using 
the volume of displaced water to measure volume"? -- Otherwise he would've long 
discovered this techinique through years of taking baths.

Therefore, if you have formed the habit of thinking, you will always have things 
to write about, things to summarise, which will in turn inspire more thought.

Of course another technique you can try is to write down those 
thought-in-progress's themselves, and try to organise them into words of 
clarity, and see what new thoughts and conclusions you can draw by going 
through this process. This is often viable. For instance, this article was once 
only three mere lines in my notebook (each containing around ten keywords) -- 
and the initial question was just yet-another-thought I had while walking 
around: "Why should anyone blog?"

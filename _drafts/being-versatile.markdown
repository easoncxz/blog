Most people, when you meet them, or get a chance to see their room, would seem quite obvious to have spent quite a lot of his/her attention on something: programming, cycling, med, foreign languages, mental illnesses etc.. But as you meet more such "mono-topical" people, you'll probably gradually find them uninteresting.
